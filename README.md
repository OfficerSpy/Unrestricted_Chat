# Unrestricted_Chat
A SourceMod plugin that allows all players to always be able to chat with each other, regardless of their current team or life state.

This is a direct recreation of [[ANY?] Dead All Talk](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2235201) by KK, so I guess credits to them for the original concept.

This should be capable of working with any game, but each one has their own offsets.
